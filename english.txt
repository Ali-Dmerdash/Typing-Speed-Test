I love deadlines and the noise they make as they go by.
Fantasy is hardly an escape from reality.
Problems are not stop signs, they are guidelines.
Die with memories, not dreams.
Aspire to inspire before we expire.
Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
Determine your priorities and focus on them.
Yesterday you said tomorrow. Just do it.
Embrace the glorious mess that you are.
When words fail, music speaks.
I have nothing to lose but something to gain.
May your choices reflect your hopes, not your fears.
